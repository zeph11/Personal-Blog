## Limitations
  **-No Authentication System:**  Currently, the website only has single-user authentication system, which means that only the owner can access and interact with the site. Other users cannot create accounts or log in to        view the content. This limitation restricts the website's audience to the owner alone.<br/>
  **-Testing Limitation:**  While efforts were made to include testing for the project using Jest, Vite's limitations prevented the full integration of the testing framework. As a result, the test coverage may be limited, and  the application has not be adequately tested.<br/>
  **Filtering, Searching, and Categorization:** The website was designed with features for filtering, searching, and categorizing blog posts to enhance user experience and content organization. However, these features have not been fully implemented at the moment. <br/>
  **-Static Featured Images:** Currently, the featured images for blog posts are static and not dynamically generated. This limitation means that each blog post's featured image is hardcoded or fixed and cannot be changed or customized by the owner when creating or editing a post. <br/>
